### Hi! Jaap here 👋 
<p align='right'><img src="https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=jaapbrasser.visitor-badge"></p>

I'm a Developer Advocate at Rubrik and the more I code the more I am starting to feel I should move out of my apartment and call [@GitHub](https://github.com/github) home...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to get better at Go & Terraform and I've been dabling in some Python & Ruby
- 🎤 I enjoy sharing my knowledge, either on stage at conferences around the globe or from behind my webcam at home 🏠
- 💬 Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments on code, or if you are looking for a speaker for your event.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - [🕊 - Twitter](https://twitter.com/@jaap_brasser/)
  - [🏢 - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/JaapBrasser/)
  - [🦑 - GitHub](https://github.com/jaapbrasser)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like animals, all animals, you can update the image by raising an issue with NEW in the title: [Update Photo Here](https://github.com/jaapbrasser/jaapbrasser/issues/new?&title=NEW%20Photo%20Please). If you have any cool photos of your pets feel free to submit a PR for my assets folder and your animals will be part of the rotation!
